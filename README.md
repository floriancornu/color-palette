# color-palette

Made to generate color palettes for data visualisations and charts.


# Inspirations & Credits

We love the [Subtleties of Color](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/05/subtleties-of-color-part-1-of-6) by [Rob Simmon](https://twitter.com/rsimmon) (and his [Medium](https://medium.com/@robsimmon).
The article led us to a [JSfiddle of palette generation](http://jsfiddle.net/d6wXV/6/embedded/result)

The color calculations are based on [ChromaJS](http://gka.github.io/chroma.js)

D3 [Scale Chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic/blob/master/README.md)

# Roadmap
- Split code html, JS and CSS
- Clean UI to make the page presentable
- Include RGB <> HEX convertor
- Include a diverging color generator
- Analyse colors generated by the palette to extract the most usable ones (ensure enough contrasts...)
- Include URL query reading to make link share-able with preset colors
